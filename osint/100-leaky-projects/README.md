## Problem Statement
We have reason to believe that some employees at Future Gadget Labs are leaking information to the public, including secret internal project details. Can you find the details on the secret project for us? Their website is at https://futuregadgetlabs.org.

## Solution
The Future Gadget Labs [https://futuregadgetlabs.org/](website) lists some employee names and gives you a rough idea of what those employees do. You can take this information and use it to find their social media accounts, including their LinkedIn accounts. Employees are constantly leaking information via LinkedIn, if you find their accounts you'll notice that Foe Jitzpatrick has leaked some details about an internal project, including the flag!
