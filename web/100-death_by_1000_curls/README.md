# Web 100 -- Death By 1000 Curls
## Description
Flask application for Death By 1000 Curls web challenge. Requires determining which URLs to visit in which order (a URL knocking scheme) to get the flag.

## Deploy
Either build and run through Docker, or by simply running:
```
python app.py
```


## Challenge
I think that's the saying...right?

flag: BSidesPDX{B3773r_th4n_d34th_By_1000_cu75}
